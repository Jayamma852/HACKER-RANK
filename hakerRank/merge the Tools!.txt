//There are three substrings of length  to consider: 'AAA', 'BCA' and 'DDE'. The first substring is all 'A' characters, so . The second substring has all distinct characters, so . The third substring has  different characters, so . Note that a subsequence maintains the original order of characters encountered. The order of characters in each subsequence shown is important.//
